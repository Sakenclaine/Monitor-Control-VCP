# Monitor Control
This project attempts to create a tool to control external monitors following the example of the discontinued ClickMonitorDDC (https://github.com/chrismah/ClickMonitorDDC7.2).
Currently only windows is supported (but maybe some day UNIX systems will also work).


# Interface
The application offers a graphical interface similar to ClickMonitorDDC and the user can change the values by hovering over a system tray icon. For better customization continous VCP-features (https://www.ddcutil.com/vcpinfo_output/ or https://milek7.pl/ddcbacklight/mccs.pdf) can be added to the collection of sliders on the right. The configuration is saved in a config.ini file and currently the best way to reset the application is to delete the config file.
